# respirator-covid
3D printing files to produce the modular respirator I designed.

Change log:
03/28 - uploaded v14 for all elements of the mask. a strap solution still needs to be designed.
03/31 - uploaded new v15 of the face mask. This mask is a more universal fit. From my testing it now fits well most people I am still in contact with.
